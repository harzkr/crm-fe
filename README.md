# Getting Started with CRM Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has a ducks pattern structure for code. Within the src folder, the components holds all corresponding code divided structurally on the routes/components that they come forth and all corresponding dependencies particular to a route are present in the same folder

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Please Note

When run directly, the app refers to the url present in the `src/utils/url.js` file, change it to your local server url if you are starting up from there

It has been configured so for deployment to heroku which is connected directly with Github

### `yarn test`

### `yarn run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
